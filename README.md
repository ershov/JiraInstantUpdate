# Jira Instant Update (browser extension)

Browser extension for live updates of the currently viewed ticket while writing a comment or just watching it.

It eliminates the unfortunate experience of seeing someone else had updated a ticket while you were writing a comment just AFTER posting one. This happens a lot with hot tickets.

It's experimental, currently works on jira.mongodb.org domain only.
